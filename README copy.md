# Laravel-12-JWT-Authentication-API
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a standard for securely transmitting information as a JSON object. It is self-contained, compact, and digitally signed. JWTs are commonly used to authenticate users in web and mobile applications, allowing the server to verify a user's identity without storing session information.
